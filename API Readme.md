### API Component - README

# API Component

## Objective
Build and maintain the API testing, simulation, and integration layer for gaming applications. This component focuses on communication protocols, data exchange validation, and ensuring seamless integration between gaming clients and the gaming backend services.

**Note:** This component provides the critical data required by the RTP component to validate game fairness and compliance.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- Playwright  
- Postman (for rapid API validation and collaborative testing)


## Your Role & Responsibilities
As the API specialist, you're responsible for the communication backbone that connects all system components. Your work focuses on:
- **API Client Simulation:** Emulating gaming client behavior and requests.
- **Protocol Management:** HTTP/WebSocket communication handling.
- **Data Validation:** Request/response schema validation and error handling.
- **Load Testing:** Simulating multiple concurrent client connections.
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end API workflow validation.

## Component Interaction
The API Component receives and processes game transactions, forwarding game round data to the RTP Component. The RTP Component relies on this data to evaluate payout fairness and compliance thresholds.

Postman collections serve as the first-line manual validation layer during API development.


## Shared Data Model
```json
{
  "betAmount": "number",
  "payout": "number",
  "gameId": "string",
  "clientId": "string"
}
```

## Workflow Structure

### Phase 1: Core API Framework (Week 1-2)
1. **Client Simulation Engine:** Build gaming client emulators.
2. **Protocol Handlers:** HTTP/WebSocket communication managers.
3. **Request/Response Models:** Data structure definitions.
4. **Authentication System:** Client authentication and session management.

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (Week 3-4)
1. **Load Testing Framework:** Concurrent client simulation.
2. **Validation Engine:** Schema and business rule validation.
3. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error detection and reporting.
4. **Monitoring System:** API performance and health tracking.


### Phase 3: Integration & Scaling (Week 5-6)
1. **RTP Integration:** Connect with RTP component for data exchange.
2. **Reporting Integration:** API metrics and performance reports.
3. **Scalability Testing:** Progressive load increase testing.
4. **Documentation:** API specifications and integration guides.

## Deliverables

### Technical Deliverables
- **Client Simulator:** Gaming client behavior emulation.
- **API Test Suite:** Comprehensive API validation tests.
- **Load Testing Engine:** Concurrent client simulation.
- **Protocol Manager:** Communication layer abstraction.
- **Data Validator:** Request/response validation system.

### Documentation Deliverables
- **API Specifications:** Complete endpoint documentation.
- **Integration Guide:** Setup and configuration instructions.
- **Test Coverage Report:** API test results and metrics.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Load testing results and analysis.
- **Use Postman for Early Testing:** 
   - Import Postman collections for:
     - Authentication
     - Game session
     - Bet placement
     - RTP validation endpoint
   - Use `newman` (Postman CLI) to integrate with CI/CD or export to Playwright later.

## Postman + Playwright Hybrid Workflow

| Tool       | Purpose                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Postman    | Manual endpoint testing + documentation  |
| Newman     | CLI automation of Postman Collections    |
| Playwright | Full automation + CI/CD integration      |


## Coding Logic & Architecture

### API Client Simulator
```javascript
// Authenticates a client and starts a game session
class GameAPIClient {
  constructor(clientId, baseURL, authConfig) {
    this.clientId = clientId;
    this.baseURL = baseURL;
    this.authToken = null;
    this.session = null;
    this.websocket = null;
  }

  async authenticate() {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/auth/login`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ clientId: this.clientId, credentials: this.authConfig })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    this.authToken = data.token;
    return data;
  }

  async startGameSession(gameId) {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/game/start`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.authToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ gameId, clientId: this.clientId })
    });
    this.session = await response.json();
    return this.session;
  }
}
```

## Getting Started Quickly

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install playwright @playwright/test dotenv
```

### Setup Environment:
```bash
npm install
npm run setup-api
```

### Configure Test Environment:
```bash
cp config/api-config.example.js config/api-config.js
# Edit configuration files
```

### Run API Tests:
```bash
npm run test:api
npm run test:load
npm run test:websocket
```

### Start Load Testing:
```bash
npm run load-test:basic
npm run load-test:stress
```

## Joint Testing
-To run end-to-end tests involving both components, ensure both the API and RTP modules are running. Integration test scripts are located in `tests/integration/`.
- Use Postman to validate API logic early.
- Feed validated response data into RTP manually or via bridge scripts.
- Convert stable Postman workflows into Playwright tests.

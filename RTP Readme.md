# RTP Component

## Objective
Build and maintain the Return to Player (RTP) calculation and validation system for gaming applications. This component focuses on mathematical accuracy, statistical analysis, and real-time monitoring of game payout percentages across multiple games and clients.

**Note:** This component directly relies on data provided by the API layer maintained by the API specialist.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- Playwright  
- Postman â€“ for development-time testing of endpoints, supplying RTP data


## Your Role & Responsibilities
As the RTP specialist, you're responsible for the mathematical engine that ensures fair play and regulatory compliance. Your work focuses on:
- **RTP Calculation Engine:** Core algorithms for computing theoretical and actual RTP values.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Variance tracking, confidence intervals, and deviation detection.
- **Data Collection:** Gathering game round data, bet amounts, and payout information.
- **Reporting Logic:** Creating mathematical models for RTP visualization and alerts.
- **Validation Rules:** Ensuring RTP values fall within acceptable regulatory ranges.

## Component Interaction
The API Component receives game requests and forwards round data (bets & payouts) to the RTP Component. The RTP Component validates RTP using this data and sends alerts if thresholds are breached.

 ðŸ“Œ If API endpoints used by the RTP module are in development, Postman can mock, test, and validate them before full automation with Playwright is implemented.


## Shared Data Model
```json
{
  "betAmount": "number",
  "payout": "number",
  "gameId": "string",
  "clientId": "string"
}
```

## Coding Logic & Architecture

### Core RTP Calculation
```javascript
// Calculates actual RTP and validates it
class RTPCalculator {
  constructor(config) {
    this.targetRTP = config.targetRTP;
    this.tolerance = config.tolerance;
    this.minSampleSize = config.minSampleSize;
  }

  calculateActualRTP(gameData) {
    const totalBets = gameData.reduce((sum, round) => sum + round.betAmount, 0);
    const totalPayouts = gameData.reduce((sum, round) => sum + round.payout, 0);
    return (totalPayouts / totalBets) * 100;
  }

  validateRTP(actualRTP, targetRTP) {
    const deviation = Math.abs(actualRTP - targetRTP);
    return {
      isValid: deviation <= this.tolerance,
      deviation: deviation,
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(actualRTP, targetRTP)
    };
  }
}
```

## Getting Started Quickly

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install playwright @playwright/test dotenv
```

### Setup Environment:
```bash
npm install
npm run setup-rtp
```

### Run Initial Tests:
```bash
npm run test:rtp
npm run test:rtp-performance
```

### Run Setup Script:
```bash
npm run setup-rtp
```

### Generate Sample Data:
```bash
npm run generate-sample-data
```

### Start RTP Monitoring:
```bash
npm run start-rtp-monitor
```

# Postman Config  
3. Optional: Use Postman Collections
   - Import RTP-related mock requests and RTP data verification workflows from Postman.
   - Collections can be exported from the API Component and manually executed or used with the Postman CLI (Newman) for mock data testing.
